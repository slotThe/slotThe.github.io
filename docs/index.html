There are very capable solutions for rendering LaTeX in <span class="small-caps">html</span> documents out there,
which in particular solve the problem of properly aligning the fragments with the rest of the text.
One of them is KaTeX,
advertising itself to be easily executed on the server-side,
avoiding the use of extraneous client-side JavaScript.
Integrating it with Hakyll turned out to be relatively straightforward,
yet I haven’t seen an actual implementation anywhere;
this post is supposed to fill that gap.

Recently, I’ve been quite invested in learning maths with <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/index.html">Anki</a>.
Sadly, there are relatively few good resources out there on how to
twist Anki’s LaTeX pipeline into something generally acceptable,
without having to rely on MathJax.
As such, this post collects some bits and pieces from all over,
hoping to weave them together into something coherent.

      Emacs’s <code>join-line</code> function,
upon execution,
joins the current line onto the previous one,
deleting any extraneous whitespace.
Alternatively, it can also sensibly act on a whole region of text.
This is quite useful,

L<span class="small-caps">sp</span> clients have the option of showing useful things on hover.

-->I have to make a confession:
I have an <a href="https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil">evil</a> past—literally.
Having switched to vanilla Emacs keybindings a while ago,
one thing that I genuinely miss from <em>that time</em> are the <code>ci(</code> and <code>ca(</code> motions,
killing everything in or around the closest encompassing <code>()</code>-environment.
Luckily, the <a href="https://github.com/magnars/change-inner.el">change-inner</a> package provides exactly these commands for Emacs proper.
Unluckily, there are some issues regarding whitespace handling—let’s try to fix that.

    <p>
      Emacs’s <code>notmuch</code> package has this fantastic concept of an <em>attachment check</em>:
adding <code>notmuch-mua-attachment-check</code> to <code>notmuch-mua-send-hook</code> will,
before sending the message,
check whether the regular expression in <code>notmuch-mua-attachment-regexp</code> matches.
If yes—and no attachment has been added—it will alert the user,
asking whether one really wants to send that email;
otherwise, everything goes through smoothly.
Due to some personal idiosyncrasies,
I needed a variant of this to check for empty subjects,
lest I become one of those people who sends emails like that.
As always, Emacs delivers.

      When writing a blog post that feels academic—or pretentious—enough to invoke the need for citations,
having them automatically generated feels like a mandatory requirement.
I can only shudder to imagine the alternatives.
<p></p>
The good news is that LaTeX has solved this problem long ago;
we now have BibTeX as a file format,
and any number of programs,
like <code>biblatex</code> or <code>natbib</code>,
to generate good-looking citations from that.
Further, everyone’s favourite document format converter<!--

All that’s left is to integrate this into Hakyll;
and to play around with it, of course!

      Classically, (algebraic) symmetric <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/operad">operads</a> are defined as certain graded objects,
each level coming equipped with a nice action of the symmetric group,
which are also monoids in some sense.
While it is often noted that the grading and action correspond exactly to the data of a functor,
the fact that virtually all of the structure needed to define operads can be expressed categorically is often passed by,
which I think is quite the shame!
In this post I want to explicitly calculate the Day convolution for symmetric operads in the category of
vector spaces—though the argument holds for all nice enough target categories—in order
to show that it is nothing but the usual tensor product of modules.

      By default, Hakyll uses pandoc to generate syntax highlighting for all
kinds of different programming languages. However, even in simple
examples the <span class="small-caps">html</span> this produces is unsatisfactory. Thankfully, the two
programs are almost infinitely customisable, and changing pretty much
any setting doesn’t usually involve a lot of work—this is no exception.
Using <code>pygmentize</code> as an example, I will show you how you can swap out
pandoc’s native syntax highlighting with pretty much any third party
tool that can output <span class="small-caps">html</span>.

has proven to be extremely useful to me, and really I couldn’t be

told me that they’re missing but one feature: the ability to immediately
refile notes.

      I have a new preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03545">on the arXiv</a>! It is joint work with
Sebastian Halbig, and concerns itself with the interplay of different
structures on monoidal categories that give rise to a notion of
“duality”. At five pages, it is a very short paper; yet I’d still like
to give a little teaser as to what kind of question we sought to answer.

<code>package-vc-install</code> function, which allows one to install packages
directly from their respective upstream source; for example, GitHub. It
can be seen as a built-in alternative to things like quelpa or

      Emacs is the “extensible text editor”, and it wouldn’t be fun if one

written a <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/tree/master/emacs"><span class="small-caps">readme</span></a> for my Emacs configuration, I
thought it might be nice to somewhat expand on certain ideas and give a

      If you’ve been doing category theory for any amount of time, you’ll
probably have stumbled upon enriched category theory as a way of
expressing categorical ideas internal to some context other than
<strong>Set</strong>. Reading into it, you might have come across these foreign
sounding concepts like weighted (co)limits and wondered what that was
all about—and then got lost for a few days, trying to decipher what
<a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html">Kelly</a> is talking about and why symbols resembling tensor
products are suddenly being thrown around. At least that’s what
happened to me.
<p></p>
After scouring the internet for good resources, I found two really
enlightening blog posts: one by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007723">Todd Trimble</a> and the
other by <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2007/02/day_on_rcfts.html#c007688">John Baez</a>—and they’re too good not to share.
Plus, people always say that you don’t understand a concept unless you
can explain it to someone else, so here’s my shot at it!

      One of my favourite—and most used—modules is <code>XMonad.​Actions.​TopicSpace</code>.
However, it seems relatively unknown among the general <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad community.
I fear this is due to the fact that the module is quite old and formerly
had a rather high barrier to entry. Despite having been given shiny
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/xmonad-contrib/docs/XMonad-Actions-TopicSpace.html">new documentation</a>, lots of people probably did not bother
revisiting it and thus still don’t really understand why they might be
interested in using topics instead of workspaces. Time to change that!

much like <a href="https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/">dmenu</a>—it is designed to rapidly capture thoughts and ideas

disrupting one’s current workflow. The module recently got support for
Org <a href="https://orgmode.org/manual/Priorities.html">priorities</a>, so I figured this was as good an excuse as
any to talk about it.

      As its name suggests, Emacs’s <code>query-replace</code> function, bound to <code>M-%</code> by default, can be used to replace occurences of one string with another—and it’s quite good at what it does.
However, there is one crucial feature missing from its default functionality: the ability to create multiple <code>from → to</code> pairs.
But this is Emacs, after all, which means that I can write that <code>query-replace-many</code> function I’ve always wanted, and even share it with others!
The <a href="#the-code">code</a> is packaged as <code>query-replace-many</code>, available on <a href="https://gitlab.com/slotThe/query-replace-many">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://github.com/slotThe/query-replace-many">GitHub</a>.

just me. After a little bit of deliberation and coming up with a
generic enough <span class="small-caps">api</span>, I decided to turn it into an <span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad module!
<p></p>
These changes now live as part of the <a href="https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib">xmonad-contrib</a> repository and

      After reading <a href="https://castel.dev/post/research-workflow/">Gilles Castel</a>’s excellent blog post about his research
workflow, I decided that it was as good a time as any to write about
mine—deeming it novel enough to hopefully contribute something to the
discussion.
<p></p>
Just like Castel, I’m a new PhD student in mathematics, which means no
lab work and—in my case—no code. Just you and your inability to
understand basic concepts. As such, I often scribble things down on
paper or a blackboard first and, when sufficiently convinced that the
information is worth keeping around, type it up. Typesetting something
is a surprisingly effective way to catch errors in handwritten
manuscripts!
<p></p>
As basically my entire digital life happens in either <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> or
<a href="https://xmonad.org/"><span class="small-caps">xm</span>onad</a>, my setup is heavily skewed in that direction; I will make use
of these tools almost every step of the way.
