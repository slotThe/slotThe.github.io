[^1] My research interests can broadly be characterised under the term
"monoidal category theory"—in particular,
I like anything involving *dualities*,
like [rigid] monoidal or [\*-autonomous] categories.
Further, I enjoy studying how algebraic gadgets lift into more categorical frameworks,
and how much theory still works in that context.
When no one's looking, I also like to study categories for their own sake.
Some more keywords include [Hopf monads], [graphical calculi], [duoidal] and [linearly distributive] categories, as well as [operads].

## Published

- *[Pivotality, twisted centres, and the anti-double of a Hopf monad]* <span class="floatright">[@halbig24:pivot-hopf]</span> \
  Joint work with Sebastian Halbig.

  Finite-dimensional Hopf algebras admit a correspondence between
  so-called pairs in involution, one-dimensional anti-Yetter–Drinfeld
  modules and algebra isomorphisms between the Drinfeld and
  anti-Drinfeld double.  We extend it to general rigid monoidal
  categories and provide a monadic interpretation under the assumption
  that certain coends exist.  Hereto we construct and study the
  anti-Drinfeld double of a Hopf monad.  As an application the
  connection with the pivotality of Drinfeld centres and their
  underlying categories is discussed.

- *[Diagrammatics for Comodule Monads]* <span class="floatright">[@halbig23:diagr-comod-monad]</span> \
  Joint work with Sebastian Halbig.

  We extend Willerton's [@Willerton2008] graphical calculus for bimonads
  to comodule monads, a monadic interpretation of module categories
  over a monoidal category. As an application, we prove a version of
  Tannaka–Krein duality for these structures.

## Preprints

- *[Duality in Monoidal Categories]* <span class="floatright">[@halbig23:dualit-monoid-categ]</span> \
  Joint work with Sebastian Halbig.

  We compare closed and rigid monoidal categories.
  Closedness is defined by the tensor product having a right adjoint:
  the internal hom functor.
  Rigidity, on the other hand, generalises the duality of finite-dimensional vector spaces.
  In the latter, the internal hom functor is implemented by tensoring with the respective duals.
  This raises the question:
  can one decide whether a closed monoidal category is rigid,
  simply by verifying that the internal hom is tensor-representable?
  We provide a counterexample in terms of finitely-generated projective objects in an abelian k-linear category.
  A byproduct of our work is that we obtain characterisations of the Grothendieck–Verdier duality,
  also called *-autonomy,
  and rigidity of functor categories endowed with Day convolution as their tensor product.
  Applied to Mackey functors,
  this yields a proof of a sketched argument by Bouc linking rigidity of an object to it being finitely-generated projective.

  Dualities are an important tool in the study of monoidal categories and their applications.
  For example, underlying the construction of Tor and Ext functors
  is the tensor–hom adjunction in the category of bimodules over a unital
  ring—this is referred to as a closed monoidal structure.
  A stronger concept, rigidity, models the behaviour of finite-dimensional vector spaces;
  that is, the existence of evaluation and coevaluation morphisms,
  implementing a notion of dual basis.
  Under delooping, this corresponds to the concept of an adjunction in a bicategory,
  with coevaluation as unit and evaluation as counit.
  Grothendieck–Verdier duality,
  also called *-autonomy,
  lies between the strict confinements of rigidity,
  and the generality of monoidal closedness.
  It is closely linked to linearly distributive categories with negation.

  An immediate consequence of rigidity is that the internal-hom functor is tensor representable.
  That is, a dualising functor sending any object to its dual exists,
  and tensoring with the object is left adjoint to tensoring with its dual.

  This raises a naive question:

    > Is a monoidal category with tensor representable internal-hom automatically rigid?

  While it is expected that this is not true in general,
  constructing counterexamples is non-trivial;
  we will provide one.
  Additionally, a weaker version of the above statement is true:
  every monoidal category with tensor representable internal-hom is Grothendieck–Verdier.

  Pairs in involution are an algebraic structure whose systematic study
  is motivated by their applications in knot theory, representation
  theory and cyclic homology theories.  We will explore a categorical
  version of these objects from the perspective of representation theory
  of monoidal categories.  A focus will lie on illustrating how their
  existence is linked to a particular well-behaved notion of duality,
  called pivotality.  As a central point, we show how the language of
  monads allows us to combine the algebraic and categorical perspective
  on such pairs.

# Theses

- *Comodules for Categories*

  Master's thesis; with the help of a higher-dimensional graphical
  calculus, the Hopf algebraic anti-Drinfeld centre is lifted into the
  language of comodule monads.  An interesting equivalence relating the
  (anti-)Drinfeld centre and (anti-)Yetter--Drinfeld modules is proven
  in this monadically enriched setting.

- *From Knot Theory to Algebra*

  Bachelor's thesis with a focus on keis; objects arising naturally when
  trying to generalize the number of 3-colourings of a knot.
