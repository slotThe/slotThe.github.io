# Abstracts

## Tony Zorman

A classical result by Moerdijk and McCrudden is that
Tannaka–Krein reconstruction for bialgebras may be lifted to bimonads:
there is a bijection between
bimonad structures on a given monad, and
monoidal structures on its Eilenberg–Moore category that are compatible with the forgetful functor.
This theorem may even be generalised to comodules over a bimonad.

In contrast to these kinds of reconstruction results,
we study reconstruction results that do not require a forgetful functor.
This comes at the cost of not recovering the algebraic object of interest on-the-nose,
but only up to Morita equivalence.
This talk generalises a result of Ostrik about Hopf algebras on a finite tensor categories
to the general case of characterising lax module monads on a nice module category over a general abelian monoidal category with enough projectives.
Crucially, the proof does not need any rigidity assumptions on the underlying category.
As an application, we give conceptual proofs of the fundamental theorem of Hopf modules,
and the fact that a bimonad is Hopf if and only if it is strong as a module monad over its base category.

The talk is based on joint work with Matti Stroiński [@stroinski2024:reconstr].

## Gabriella Böhm

The talk will deal with three levels of generality.
The first, most general setting is categories with one lax, and one oplax monoidal structure, related by a duoidal compatibility, with emphasis on the bimonoids in them.
Examples of such lax duoidal categories are shown to be provided by endohom categories of pseudomonoids in symmetric monoidal bicategories with certain internal homs.
Our main interest is in the symmetric monoidal bicategory $\mathsf{Bim}$ of algebras, bimodules, and bimodule maps.
For any algebra $R$, the enveloping algebra $R^{\mathsf{op}} \otimes R$ is a pseudomonoid in $\mathsf{Bim}$.
Since in $\mathsf{Bim}$ the internal homs are provided by the genuine hom, the endohom category $\mathsf{Bim}(R^{\mathsf{op}} \otimes R,R^{\mathsf{op}} \otimes R)$—the category of bimodules over the enveloping algebra—becomes lax duoidal.
Its bimonoids are known as (Takeuchi) bialgebroids over the base algebra $R$.

The second, more restrictive setting means bimonoids in proper (no longer lax) duoidal categories.
Examples come again from endohom categories, studied by Street.
He showed that both monoidal structures of the duoidal endohom category are strong for a pseudomonoid whose multiplication and the unit have (left or right) adjoints.
This covers important classes of bialgebroids like weak bialgebras and bialgebroids over a central base.

In the third situation, there is a further "reversion" structure on a duoidal category.
Examples come again from endohom categories, under the assumption that in addition to the existence of adjoints for the multiplication and the unit, the multiplication of a pseudomonoid also satisfies López Franco's naturally Frobenius condition.
In the resulting duoial endohom category, under a minor further assumption about the availability of a conservative forgetful-type functor, it was shown by Böhm–Lack that a bimonoid induces a Hopf monad if and only if it induces a Hopf comonad, if and only if it possesses an antipode (connecting the bimonoid with its "reversed" mate).
This still covers the above examples of weak bialgebras and bialgebroids over a central base (while for general bialgebroids, a counterexample is due to Krähmer–Rovi).

## Ivan Bartulović

Cyclic homology of algebras was independently introduced by Connes and Tsygan in the 1980s.
Since then, their constructions have been considered in many versions and generalizations.
In this talk we focus on the monadic framework by Böhm and Ştefan, which is later studied in the paper by Kowalzig, Krähmer and Slevin.
The ingredients of the setup are two comonads, a distributive law between them and right and left coalgebras over the distributive law.
While right coalgebras over it have an easy and known description, no similar was known for left coalgebras over it.
After recalling some background and motivation, I will explain how the latter can be obtained under some additional assumptions.
Finally, I will discuss how generalized Hopf module theorem by Mesablishvili and Wisbauer features both in theory and examples.
Based on joint work with John Boiquaye and Ulrich Krähmer, [@bartulović25:duplic-hopf].

## Sebastian Halbig

In 1997, Alexei Kitaev proposed a foundational model for fault-tolerant quantum computation based on complex semisimple Hopf algebras.
Its key feature is a topologically invariant code space.
It is constructed using combinatorial data encoded by a graph embedded into a closed oriented surface, ensuring robustness against a wide range of errors.
Beyond applications in quantum computing, the model has remarkable connections with combinatorics, the study of mapping class groups, Hopf algebra representation theory, and topological quantum field theories.
In this talk, based on joint work with  U. Krähmer, we present a generalisation of the Kitaev model to arbitrary finite-dimensional Hopf algebras.

Two challenges prevent a straightforward approach.
First, the extended Hilbert space, a Yetter–Drinfeld module whose maximal trivial submodule is the code space, relies on an involutive antipode—a condition equivalent to the underlying Hopf algebra being semisimple.
Second, topological invariance is proven using projectors assembled from (co)integrals.
Since we do not have these tools at our disposal, we follow a new approach, inspired by homological considerations.
We introduce involutive anti-Hopf bimodules, which are related to coefficients of Hopf cyclic cohomology and allow us to form appropriate, Yetter–Drinfeld valued, variants of extend Hilbert spaces.
Instead of considering trivial submodules, the analoga of the code spaces arise as bitensor products—a combination of cotensor and tensor products.
Our proof of their topological invariance relies on a notion of excision and uses actions of a group related to mapping class groups.
Towards computing bitensor products, we discuss induction-restriction type identities, which are particularly useful for small quantum groups.
Several intriguing open questions arising from our approach will be emphasised.

## Niels Kowalzig

Building on Retakh's approach to Ext groups through categories of extensions, Schwede reobtained the well-known Gerstenhaber algebra structure on Ext groups over bimodules of associative algebras both from splicing extensions (leading to the cup product) and from a suitable loop in the categories of extensions (leading to the Lie bracket).
We show how Schwede's construction admits a vast generalisation to general monoidal categories with coefficients of the Ext groups taken in (weak) left and right monoidal (or Drinfel'd) centres.
In case of the category of left modules over bialgebroids and coefficients given by commuting pairs of braided (co)commutative (co)monoids in these categorical centres, we provide an explicit description of the algebraic structure obtained this way, and a complete proof that this leads to a Gerstenhaber algebra is then obtained from an operadic approach.
This, in particular, considerably generalises the classical construction given by Gerstenhaber himself.
Conjecturally, the algebraic structure we describe should produce a Gerstenhaber algebra for an arbitrary monoidal category enriched over abelian groups, but even the bilinearity of the cup product and of the Lie-type bracket defined by the abstract construction in terms of extension categories remain elusive in this general setting.

## Marvin Dippell

The classical Hochschild–Kostant–Rosenberg (HKR) Theorem in Differential Geometry gives a quasi-isomorphism between the differentiable Hochschild complex of the algebra of smooth functions on a manifold and the multivector fields on it.
The HKR morphism plays an important role in deformation theory, in particular it appears in deformation quantization as lowest degree of Kontsevich’s formality.
Even though the HKR Theorem has been known for a long time, available proofs are often of a local nature and are hard to generalize to more structured situations.
I will present a novel proof for the HKR Theorem using a symbol calculus and a van Est-double complex.
This strategy will allow for an explicit global homotopy and can easily be adapted to various situations.
As examples, I will present HKR Theorems for submanifolds and surjective submersions, as well as equivariant versions for both Lie group and Lie algebra actions.

## Nir Gadish

How can we tell if a group element can be written as a $k$-fold nested commutator?
One approach is to find computable invariants of words in groups, that vanish on all $(k-1)$-fold commutators but not on $k$-fold ones.
We introduce the theory of letter-braiding invariants—these are "polynomial" functions on words, inspired by the homotopy theory of loop-spaces and Koszul duality, and carrying deep geometric content.
They extend the influential Magnus expansion of free groups, which already had countless applications in low dimensional topology, into a functor defined on arbitrary groups.
As a consequence we get new combinatorial formulas for braid and link invariants, and a way to linearize automorphisms of general groups which specializes to the Johnson homomorphism of mapping class groups.
