title: Using XMonad with NixOS

I recently switched to NixOS,
and one of the first tasks was to properly set up my window manager of choice—XMonad, of course.
Luckily, the project provides a custom flake that makes pretty very straightforward;
if you know your way around flakes and Nix, that is.
I don't yet, so I hit some rough spots.
Since providing more documentation always sounds like a worthwhile goal,
this post is just that: a diff-by-diff guide on how everything was set up on my side.

As indicated, I'll be working with direct diffs from my configuration;
this seems to tell the story in the most accurate way.
Because scrolling through lots of diffs is about as fun as a visit to the dentist,
they are all tucked away in expandable sections

# Setup

First and foremost I should mention that XMonad does in fact have some documentation on how to set up the flake:
it's tucked away in [NIX.md](https://github.com/xmonad/xmonad-contrib/blob/master/NIX.md).
The process mainly consists of two parts:
adding an `xmonad-contrib` input to your system flake,
and enabling this functionality in `windowManager.xmonad`.

After having added the input, making use of the flake is quite easy.[^2]

And that's really it!
No need to write a custom `launch` function and similar shenanigans,
the flake takes care of all of those details for you—pretty neat, I think;
thanks [Leary](https://github.com/lsleary)!

# Primitive Emacs integration

Though not directly relevant to making the flake work,
a nice-to-have feature is Emacs support.
One could [create a cabal project][nix:xmonad-hs-cabal-project] to get real `haskell-language-server` support,
but that seems a bit overkill to me.
I don't really need more than a `ghci` session for my configuration<!--
-->—anything complicated enough to warrant a language server should immediately be upstreamed into `xmonad-contrib`.

In Emacs's `haskell-mode`,
executing `haskell-interactive-bring` (bound to `C-c C-c` by default)
brings up a `ghci` session.[^1]
Rather obviously, this fails out of the box.
It tries to call the global `ghci`,
which doesn't come from the flake,
and is thus not equipped with `xmonad-contrib` and other dependencies that I might have.

The low-tech solution I chose here is twofold;
first, I outsourced starting the Emacs daemon from my xinitrc to my XMonad configuration file.
In this way, the resulting Emacs instance comes equipped with the `$XMONAD_GHC` environment variable.

All that's left now is to set some local variable,
making Emacs aware that it should use another GHC version for my `xmonad.hs`.

Now `C-c C-c` works out of the box!

[nix:xmonad-hs-cabal-project]: https://srid.ca/xmonad-conf-ide

[^1]: More precisely, I have `C-c C-c` bound to

      ``` emacs-lisp
      (defun slot/haskell-load-and-bring ()
        "Sane behaviour when loading the current file into ghci."
        (interactive)
        (save-buffer)
        (haskell-process-load-file)
        (haskell-interactive-bring))
      ```

      but this is only a small quality of life wrapper.

[^2]: Note the presence of the `enableConfiguredRecompile` flag—this is necessary for `M-q` recompilation to work out of the box!
      I figured that out so you don't have to.
      Make sure that the revision of `nixpkgs` that you track is recent enough,
      else this flag may not be available.

      Also, don't forget to provide XMonad with your configuration,
      lest you will be greeted by a black screen upon login.

      Note that `xmonad-contrib.modernise.${system}` was only temporarily needed until nixpkgs caught up with some upstream changes in XMonad.
      If you still have this in your flake, you should probably remove it—it might lead to quirky behaviour upon evaluation!
