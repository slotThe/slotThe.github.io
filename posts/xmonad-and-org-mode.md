As I've said before, basically my entire digital life happens in either
[Emacs] or [XMonad].  Thus, a lot of time spent on my setup either goes
towards working on the two configurations separately, or—as we'll do
today—bringing them ever closed together.

Specifically, I want to showcase a new[^1] XMonad module:
[XMonad.​Prompt.​Org&shy;Mode].  Building on top of XMonad's prompt—which works
much like [dmenu]—it is designed to rapidly capture thoughts and ideas
whenever inspiration strikes and, importantly, to do so without
disrupting one's current workflow.  The module recently got support for
Org [priorities][priority], so I figured this was as good an excuse as
any to talk about it.

## Motivation

One theme in the post about my [research workflow] was how it's possible
to use org-mode (with all of its appendages, like [org-roam]) to
organise one's thoughts.  `XMonad.Prompt.OrgMode` was created as yet
another link in that chain.  Unlike when writing tiny [Emacs Lisp
scripts in XMonad][calling-emacs-from-xmonad], this does not involve any
custom elisp code one has to run; all of it is taken care of by the
module itself.

The upshot of all of this is a tool to quickly and unobtrusively jot
down an idea—quiet the monkey mind—and then get back to work straight
away.  For me, having something like this is very important, lest I get
distracted by some thought about another project and spend the next hour
or so working on that instead of doing what I was actually supposed to
do.  Having the idea written down in a known place—perhaps even with an
automatic reminder in my [agenda]—helps me get rid of that creeping
anxiety that I'm forgetting things left and right.

## Functionality

The following showcases the core functionality of the module—taking
notes!

In case you _really_ don't want to forget something, there is also the
ability to create `DEADLINE` and `SCHEDULED` tasks.  Optionally, you can
also specify a [priority], depending on the importance of the note.  If
you add the org file in which the TODOs are placed to the
`org-agenda-files` variable, then this will immediately show these tasks
in your agenda!

How exactly one may specify the `SCHEDULED` and `DEADLINE` keywords, as
well as a date, time, and priority is covered in detail in the
[documentation][XMonad.Prompt.OrgMode] for `X.P.OrgMode`.

Last but not least, it's possible to capture the current (primary)
selection and, depending on the type of thing in it, use that as either
the body or the header of the task.  If it's a URL, create a link (i.e.,
it will be of the form `[[link][input-text]]`); if not, just add the
selection to the body of the note.

Of course, you can use all of this together as well—directly link to
that one paper or blog post you wanted to read, or that one YouTube
video you want to watch on the weekend!

## Sample configuration

To round things off—and quickly showcase another cool (and new!)
module, [XMonad.Actions.Prefix]—here is a sample keybinding that takes
"normal" `TODO` notes on `M-o c`[^2] and uses the selection when called
with a universal argument:

``` haskell
-- uses {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}
orgKey :: (String, X ())
orgKey =
  ("M-o c", withPrefixArgument $ (`uncurry` orgSettings) . \case
     Raw _ -> orgPromptPrimary promptNoHist
     _     -> orgPrompt        promptNoHist)
 where
  orgSettings = ("TODO", "~/todos.org")
```

I've found `M-u` to be quite convenient for XMonad's universal argument
key, mirroring the `C-u` convention from Emacs.  In either case, simply
add the `usePrefix​Argument` combinator somewhere to your `main` function
and give it your preferred keybinding.  For example:

``` haskell
main :: IO ()
main = xmonad
     . usePrefixArgument "M-u"
     $ def{ modMask = mod4Mask  -- use <Super> as mod
          }
```

If you're anything like me, this will soon become an integral part of
your workflow and you won't want to live without it.  If not, then
perhaps you still don't understand what all the fuss is about; in either
case, I'd like to [hear from you](mailto:mail@tony-zorman.com)!
