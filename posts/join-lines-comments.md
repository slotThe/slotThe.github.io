Emacs's `join-line` function,
upon execution,
joins the current line onto the previous one,
deleting any extraneous whitespace.
Alternatively, it can also sensibly act on a whole region of text.
This is quite useful,
though sadly the function does not handle comments very gracefully by default;
let's fix that.

<!--more-->

Actually an alias for `delete-indentation`,
`join-line`'s behaviour is perhaps more easily seen
rather than explained.[^8]

However, the default implementation of that function is quite oblivious to comments—in the sense that it doesn't care about them at all!

     src="../images/join-line/join-line-comment.gif"
     alt="Original join-line behaviour with respect to comments.">

This is a bit annoying, though thankfully it's not difficult to fix!
`delete-indentation` already has some code that removes a possibly-present `fill-prefix`[^2] variable:

``` emacs-lisp
(defun delete-indentation (&optional arg beg end)
  …
  (let ((prefix (and (> (length fill-prefix) 0)
                     (regexp-quote fill-prefix))))
    (while (and (> (line-beginning-position) beg)
                (forward-line 0)
                (= (preceding-char) ?\n))
      (delete-char -1)
      ;; If the appended line started with the fill prefix,
      ;; delete the prefix.
      (if (and prefix (looking-at prefix))
          (replace-match "" t t))
      (fixup-whitespace))))
```

Adjusting this to my idiosyncratic preferences is quite straightforward:
just set `fill-prefix` to the current comment syntax[^3], and let the function do the rest.

``` emacs-lisp
(advice-add 'delete-indentation :around
  (lambda (old-fun &optional arg beg end)
    (let ((fill-prefix comment-start))
      (funcall old-fun arg beg end))))
```

Pretty neat, huh?
Sadly, this does not quite work yet!

<img class="pure-img"
     src="../images/join-line/join-line-advise.gif"
     alt="Advised join-line behaviour with respect to comments.">

The point is that `comment-start` for `emacs-lisp-mode` is simply `"; "`,
but by convention comments on their own line get two such semicolons instead.
This is also not difficult to fix,
but requires [monkey-patching] `delete-indentation` itself,
rather than just having to advise it.
Ostensibly all we have to do is to change[^4]

``` emacs-lisp
(if (and prefix (looking-at prefix))
  …)
```

to

``` emacs-lisp
(while (and prefix (looking-at prefix))
  …)
```

While we're at it,
we might as well remove the advice and hard-code the `fill-prefix` into the function.
Modulo some minor details,
this gives us the finished product,
which works as expected in all situations I've cared to try it in![^7]

``` emacs-lisp
(defun delete-indentation (&optional arg beg end)
  "Join this line to previous and fix up whitespace at join.

line.
With prefix ARG, join the current line to the following line.

define.  Interactively, BEG and END are, respectively, the start

ignored if prefix ARG is given.)

[^2]: This is a "String for filling to insert at front of new line, or nil for none."

[^3]: This is helpfully provided by the `comment-start` variable.

    Notice that the `if` in the code is really a `when`.

      It is in moments like these that I'm extremely glad about<!--
      -->—albeit a bit scared of—<!--
      -->Emacs's infinite customisability.
      If something doesn't work to your liking,
      just overwrite a builtin function;
      what's the worst that could happen?

      In case you don't want to copy the whole function,
      you can find a small package for it
      on [Microsoft GitHub](https://github.com/slotThe/delete-indentation-comments).

      In daily usage, I have this bound to `C-u C-w`,
      where `C-w` itself is bound to what's essentially `backward-kill-word`;
      see [here](https://gitlab.com/slotThe/dotfiles/-/blob/5929dc10bcbdf0d3531bd6f9940f54f8294a27a3/emacs/lisp/hopf-keybindings.el#L131)
      for the full function.
