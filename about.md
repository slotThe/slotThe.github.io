title: About
---

I'm a PhD student in mathematics at TU Dresden, Germany.
In my copious free time[^1] I like to
hack on [free software]—especially anything involving [Haskell] or [Emacs]—<!--
-->play the guitar,
boulder a little bit too enthusiastically for my own good,
and watch classic movies.
I also spend way too much money on (good) coffee and tea.

Broadly, my work in mathematics lives under the umbrella of *monoidal category theory* and *categorical reconstruction theory*.[^3]
In particular, I like thinking about [Hopf monads]; [graphical calculi]; [rigid],
[linearly distributive], [Grothendieck–Verdier], and [duoidal] categories;
as well as [operads].
If you're interested in my publications, you can check out my name on the [arXiv].
I've also given some talks, with a few slides available [here](https://tony-zorman.com/research.html#talks).

As for the site itself: everything is statically generated—with the power of [hakyll] and [pandoc]—from markdown.
The [full source code][site] is available,
and a separate page detailing some design decisions is [here](./site.html).

  For reference: here are my
  [Emacs][cfg:emacs],
  [QMK][cfg:qmk],
  and [KMonad][cfg:layout]
  configurations.
</span>
All posts are written on a TUXEDO Aura 14 in GNU Emacs, probably on an [Atreus][site:atreus].
If the latter is unavailable, [KMonad] supplies me with a proper keyboard layout.

[^1]: I wish.

[^3]: Incidentally, the latter is also the name of my thesis,
      which will be posted here once I'm able to do so.
      You can, however, already read about the typographical aspects of it
      [here](https://tony-zorman.com/posts/phd-typesetting.html).
