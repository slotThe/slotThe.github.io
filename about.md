title: About
---

I'm a PhD student in mathematics at the Technical University of Dresden, Germany.
In my copious free time[^1] I like to hack on [free software]—especially anything involving [Haskell] or [Emacs]—play the guitar, ride my bike around, or watch classic movies.
I also spend way too much money on (good) coffee and tea.

My work in mathematics can broadly be characterised under the term "monoidal category theory".
In particular, I like thinking about things like
[Hopf monads]; [graphical calculi]; [rigid], [Grothendieck–Verdier][^3], [linearly distributive], and [duoidal] categories; as well as [operads].
If you're interested in my publications, you can check out my name on the [arXiv].
I've also given some talks, slides of which are available [here](./research.html).

As for the site itself: everything is statically generated—with the power of [hakyll] and [pandoc]—from markdown.[^2]
The full source code is available [here][site].

  For reference: here are my
  [Emacs][cfg:emacs],
  [QMK][cfg:qmk],
  and [KMonad][cfg:layout]
  configurations.
</span>
All posts are written on a TUXEDO Aura 14 in GNU Emacs, probably on an [Atreus][site:atreus].
If the latter is unavailable, [KMonad] supplies me with a proper keyboard layout.

Most of the time I'm fastest to reply via E-Mail,

[^1]: I wish.

[^2]: Org-mode would, of course, be preferrable, but markdown is pretty
      alright for this specific use-case.

[^3]: Also known as \*-autonomous categories.
