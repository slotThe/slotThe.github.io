I'm a
[postdoc](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1744)
in mathematics at the
[University of Hamburg](https://www.uni-hamburg.de/en/)
in the group of
[Christoph Schweigert](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/schweigert/).
Previously, I was a
[PhD student](https://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1286)
at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/)
under the supervision of
[Ulrich Krähmer](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/geometrie/kraehmer).

Broadly, my work in mathematics lives under the umbrella of *monoidal category theory* and *categorical reconstruction theory*.[^3]
In particular, I like thinking about [Hopf monads]; [graphical calculi]; [rigid],
[linearly distributive], [Grothendieck–Verdier], and [duoidal] categories;
as well as [operads].
If you're interested in my publications, you can check out my name on the [arXiv].
I've also given some talks, with a few slides available [here](https://tony-zorman.com/research.html#talks).

In my copious free time[^1] I like to
hack on [free software],
play the guitar,
boulder a little bit too enthusiastically for my own good,
and watch classic movies.
I also spend way too much money on (good) coffee and tea.

All posts are written on a TUXEDO Aura 14 in GNU Emacs, probably on an [Atreus][site:atreus].
If the latter is unavailable, [KMonad] supplies me with a proper keyboard layout.

[^1]: I wish.

[^3]: Not-quite-so-incidentally, the latter is also the name of my dissertation,
      which you can access [here](./dissertation.pdf).
      I've also
      [written about](https://tony-zorman.com/posts/phd-typesetting.html)
      some typographical aspects of it.
